# UrlShortener

1. This solution was created with Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.  It includes a localDB implementation you can use for the database portion of the tool.
2. You will need to create a Database in order to run the solution on your local machine. There is a script in UrlShortener/UrlMini/UrlMini/App_Publishing/CreateDatabase_urlmini_db.sql to help with this purpose.  Update the App.Config file to reflect your local environment.
3. In order to run most of the tests against Azure, I need to whitelist your IP address.
4. It is highly recommended you have Firefox, Chrome, IE, and Edge browsers installed for running all the selenium cases.
